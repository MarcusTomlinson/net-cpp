    shared into their own header/implementation files. Provide an async
    interface to executing requests. Provide basic and digest auth
    support.
  * Cleanup error handling. Add documentation for
    core::net::http::Request.
  * Add documentation and clean up.
  * Add load tests and statistics.

  * Remove references to core::net::Uri.
  * Remove further references to core::net::Uri.

    fields.
  * Make sure that we kill the entire python process group running the
    httpbin instance.
  * Run httpbin without the flask-weirdness to allow for killing it with
    a vanilla unix signal. Make sure we execute all the right tests :-)
