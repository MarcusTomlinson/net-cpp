  [ Ubuntu daily release ]
  * debian/*symbols: auto-update new symbols to released version

  [ thomas-voss ]
  * Initial checkin.
  * Adjusted URI parsing.
  * Add documentation for the Uri class.
  * Added an exception for signalling parsing errors.
  * GET, POST, PUT, HEAD now works.
  * Add tests working against the mozilla location service. Add a
    missing handle reset for handles recycled from the pool.
  * Add curl multi support.
  * Cleanup curl based implementatoin and split out easy, multi and
    shared into their own header/implementation files. Provide an async
    interface to executing requests. Provide basic and digest auth
    support.
  * Cleanup error handling. Add documentation for
    core::net::http::Request.
  * Add documentation and clean up.
  * Add load tests and statistics.
  * Add debian packaging. Add timeout for requests. Add cancel
    functionality for requests.
  * Add pkg-config setup.
  * Add doc package. Add symbols file and symbols map.
  * Enable ssl default engine. Disable host and peer ssl checks.
  * Make sure that a request survives an async execution.
  * Add libcurl4-openssl-dev as a build-dependency. Ensure that no
    signals are being caught by curl. Switch to production url for
    Mozilla's location service.
  * Get rid of custom Uri class, not needed right now. Add custom header
    support for http requests.
  * Make test-cases standalone by running a local instance of httpbin.
  * Add bzr builddeb configuration.
  * Remove references to core::net::Uri.
  * Remove further references to core::net::Uri.
  * Adjust path to server executable in tests. Add missing build
    dependencies.
  * Make sure that we do not block indefinitely waiting for the httpbin
    instance to be torn down.
  * Make sure to strip leading and trailing whitespace from header
    fields.
  * Make sure that we kill the entire python process group running the
    httpbin instance.
  * Run httpbin without the flask-weirdness to allow for killing it with
    a vanilla unix signal. Make sure we execute all the right tests :-)
  * Disable test case running against the Ubuntu app store.
  * Merged lp:~pete-woods/net-cpp/base64

  [ CI bot ]
  * Empty MP for landing.
